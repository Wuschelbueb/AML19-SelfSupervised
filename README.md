    Task: Classification of different fashion items with Self Supervised Learning

    Architecture
        ResNet-101 (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html)
        
    Pretrainig
        - Image Rotation Predictions
        - Maybe Colorization or other pretraining methods, still TBD
        

We'll first test our implementation on the MNIST (https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) to get an idea about the performance.
